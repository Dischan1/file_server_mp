# file_server_mp
multi-platform file server for Windows/Linux
 
## About
it is a simple multi-platform file server, it can send and receive single files between different platforms (Windows/Linux).
it has a RSA cryptography and a client identifications is a unique random numbers, generated by client. 
These keys are install on the server-side. Them are need to be placed in the root directory where the executable server is located. You need to move both keys there.
 
## Building
### Windows
```
cl.exe client.c     -o client.exe
cl.exe server.c     -o server.exe
cl.exe client_gui.c -o client_gui.exe
```
### Linux
```
gcc.exe client.c -o client.out
gcc.exe server.c -o server.out
```
## Usage
### Server
```
server <port>
```
starts the server
`port` - port for accepting a remote connections

### Client
```
client <ip> <port> <passphrase> [r/t] <from> <to>
client <ip> <port> <passphrase> l <path>
client <ip> <port> <passphrase> m <message>
client <ip> <port> <passphrase> g
```
connects to the server  
`ip`        - remote server ip for connection  
`port`      - remote server port for connection  
`passphrase`- your a secret phrase for connection  
`r/t`       - file transfer direction (receive - receiving a file from a server/transmit - transmitting a file to a server)  
`l`         - listing a directory from remote server  
`m`         - message for a server  
`g`         - register on a server  
`from`      - source directory from a server on receive or source directory from a client on transmit  
`to`        - destination directory for a client on receive or destination directory for a server on transmit  
`path`      - a directory from remote server  
  
`path`, `from` and `to` paths are relative by default
## Client GUI
it was developer to make it easier to use the windows program.

`ip port` and `passphrase` are mandatory. group of `path` and `receive` items are used for server directory listing, `message` and `send` are used for send a message to the server, `source`, `destination` and `receive`, `transmit` are used to download and upload files respectively.
